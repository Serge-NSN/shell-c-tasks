# shell-c-tasks
Exercise One:
Write a shell script that uses bash interpreter which will take just one parameter, compile and run the C file that corresponds to that parameter.
- Do not use "make" in the script.
- If the C file doesn't exist, the script should show an appropriate message indicating this error.
- If the file passed is not a C file, the script should show an appropriate message indicating this error.
